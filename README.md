# MediaTek

MediaTek is a personnal media database for personnal use, base on [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com). It aims to make easy the comics enumeration for the user, fetch cover from [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) picture search engine and provide a way to know who the fuck I lent the *Walking Dead #7* book! :-)

## Scope of features

Currently the project is empty but let's start to define [here](https://github.com/MartinDelille/BDTek/issues).

## Want to help?

Pull request and issue reporting are welcomed!

If you're interested in the project but don't know how to code, [tip me](https://gratipay.com/MartinDelille) or join the project IRC channel (phonations.com / #mediatek)!
